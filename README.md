>>>HR Employee Tracker

A desktop HR management application built with Python and Tkinter.
Employees and departments can be created, read, updated and deleted. Employees can also be added and removed from departments. 
Login is supported, and different users have different levels of permissions which affects what they can do.

>>Some example users to use with the default data - Passwords have been made easy to input, they wouldn't be recommended for users:

Daniel Evans (Customer Support) Login: emp_3a7da1ec Password: Daniel@123 - Daniel has no permissions above a normal user. He can see everyone's name and role, view departments and their members, and change his own password, but nothing else 

Evelyn Brown (Finance Analyst) Login: emp_de2a5cb8 Password: Evelyn@123 - with "payroll" permission, Evelyn is allowed to view salaries of every employee, but not edit them.

Natalie Hughes (Financial Controller) Login: emp_98fabb91 Password: Natalie@123 - with "finance_edit" permission, Natalie is able to edit users' salaries. She is also head of the Finance department, so can add members to it.

Grace Turner (Recruitment Officer) Login: emp_a5cd8b6a Password: Grace@123 - with "hr_read" permission, Grace can view other users' addresses, but not edit them

Alice Johnson (HR Manager) Login: emp_673342f5 Password: Alice@123 - with "hr_write" permission, Alice cannot change other users' passwords, but has access to everything else

Ben Carter (Software Engineer) Login: emp_d5ad1319 Password: Ben@123 - with the "it_admin" permission, Ben has full access to any changes


>>Features

Secure login with hashed passwords (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256)
Role based permissions for creating, reading, updating and deleting data
Employee management (create, read, update, delete)
Department management (create, read, update, delete, manage members)
CSV-based data storage - Initially this was intended to be an SQL database, but for time's sake, it was altered to be CSV storage
Automatic sample data generation on first run
Extensive pytest test suite - testing of GUI components proved difficult, so these were not as extensive as desired

>>Requirements

Python 3.10+
pandas
pytest (for running tests)

>>Install dependencies:

pip install pandas pytest

>>Running the Application

From the project root:
python -m employee_tracker.gui.main_window

On first run, if no CSV files exist, sample data will be generated automatically.
If CSVs are not showing correct data (common after running tests), simply close the app, delete offending CSV and then restart, it will be repopulated.

>>Running Tests

From the project root:
pytest
For verbose output:
pytest -vv

>>>Notes

Data is stored in employee_tracker/data/ as CSV files.
Passwords are never stored in plaintext.
Permissions control what users can view and edit within the GUI.
This project was made predominantly using test-driven development (aside from the GUI components) - GUI tests were generated by AI, but they were difficult to follow, and the developer decided not to include them as there was not time to adequately learn the functionality.
